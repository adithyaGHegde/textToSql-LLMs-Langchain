# textToSql on Vehicle insurance database

Working on the text to SQL i.e this will convert natural language text into SQL commands to act on the vehicle insurance database that was previosuly created by my group for a college project at: https://github.com/adithyaGHegde/DBMS-PROJECT-TEAM-10-/tree/main

This project uses the PaLM API, and Langchain, and Huggingface embeddings to generate the vectors that are stored in a ChromaDB. It uses few shot learning to better the LLM.
